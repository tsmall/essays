# Photo Essays

This repo contains both the source of my photo essays
(in the `master` branch)
and the static site itself
(in the `gh-pages` branch).
It's built using the wonderful [Expose](https://github.com/Jack000/Expose) static site generator.

## Notes

 * I had to copy Expose to customize the theme.
