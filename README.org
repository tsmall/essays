#+TITLE: Smallgren Stories
#+AUTHOR: Tom Small III
#+STARTUP: showall

This repository contains the source of the Smallgren photo stories. These
stories are hosted on our website, at http://www.smallgren.com/stories. It's
built using the wonderful [[https://github.com/Jack000/Expose][Expose]] static site generator.

* Organization

The source for this site is written as a literate program. I've chosen to use
Emacs's [[http://orgmode.org/][Org Mode]] as my literate programming tool. Each story is its own Org
file. I think of each of them as one chapter in a book. Here's the table of
contents:

- [[file:src/2015.org][2015]]
- [[file:src/2016.org][2016]]
- [[file:src/2018.org][2018]]

* Commit message guidelines

I started by following a Conventional Commits-like format. But I've decided
that doesn't really add anything. So now I just try to make sure the messages
are clear and helpful, with a short subject line and an optional longer body.
