The following morning,
before making the long drive to Iowa,
we met up with Uncle Norm for breakfast at the Silver Grill Cafe.

<span class="voice--teresa">
Norm isn't actually my uncle,
but he becomes an uncle to anyone who takes the time to get to know him.
Since co-hosting Runaway Fiddle with Norm, many years ago,
seeing him has been a must every time we come home to Fort Collins.
