And here we are, at our penultimate reception party in Lake Placid.
We spent a great afternoon celebrating with my family
and many of my close high school friends.
And, though we sadly didn't play,
Twice on Sundays (my high school band) had its first reunion in many years.

We had one final party in Brooklyn when we got home,
though sadly we don't have any photos of it.
It was a nice way to end the celebration,
bringing people from both of our lives together in one place again.
