To wrap up our trip, we traveled north to Seattle.
We visited MoPOP,
which was still the Experience Music Project the last time Teresa was there.
Carole and Tim brought us to the famed Pike Place Market.
(<span class="voice--tom">My first time ever there!</span>)
We had phenomenal coffee,
the likes of which we unfortunately can't get back home.
(<span class="voice--teresa">And here you thought New York had everything!</span>)
