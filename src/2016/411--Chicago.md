In Chicago
— stop number five on our trip —
we met up with a group of my friends from college.
This was, sadly, my first time visiting Chicago.
We had a great time there, with great company, and can't wait to go back.

I was born in Chicago but have no memories of it;
we moved when I was a month old.
This was my first time visiting in more than half a lifetime.
