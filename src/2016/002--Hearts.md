## Happy Valentine's Day.

Have we got a lot to share with you!
2016 was an incredibly eventful year,
personally,
professionally,
academically,
pet-ly.
Fami-ly?
Traila has a new frenemy.
We just got used to saying "fianc√©(e)"
before we needed to start saying "husband" and&nbsp;"wife."

We're still happy here in New York City,
seeing as much theater as we can
and going to trivia nearly every week.
(We're *so close* to&nbsp;winning.)
