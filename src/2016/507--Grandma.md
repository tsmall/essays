<span class="voice--teresa">
In Denver we had dinner with my Grandma Alice,
uncle Peter,
aunt Lucille,
and might-as-well-be-family Lea.
The next day we had lunch with Grandma at her apartment.

<span class="voice--teresa">
I am sad knowing now that this was the last time I would see my Grandma,
but happy that we had such a good time together,
sharing beautiful weather and good conversation.
</span>

<span class="voice--tom">
I'm also very grateful that we had this time together,
and for having a chance to get to know Alice.
She wore such a warm, welcoming smile every time I met her,
and made me feel immediately part of the family.
