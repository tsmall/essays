I've stayed very busy at Schoology,
where I was promoted to Engineering Manager.
I'm now in charge of two teams of engineers,
one building our iOS and Android apps,
and the other making our software work with all the other software schools already use.

It has been a fun, challenging new role,
and I'm learning every day.
