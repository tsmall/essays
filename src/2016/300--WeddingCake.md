Now, where were we?
Oh right!
And in the middle of all of this,

## We got married!

Hitched.
Man and wife.
And we had an amazing wedding.

We rented a property north of Santa Fe for three nights
and hosted all of our immediate family.
It was relaxed.
In the days around the wedding people came and went as they pleased.
We explored Santa Fe.
We hiked.
We went to the [Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta][fiesta].
And we just generally had a good time together.

It was nice having our families together in one place,
the first time we were actually able to do that.
