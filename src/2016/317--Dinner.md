The wedding ceremony and dinner were exactly what we'd hoped they'd be:
cozy, intimate, and easygoing.
Tim and Carole chose a signature cocktail for each of us:
the Spicy Tom
and the Teresa No. 5.
The food was delicious:
New Mexican standards,
enchiladas and chile rellenos.
Everything felt perfect.
