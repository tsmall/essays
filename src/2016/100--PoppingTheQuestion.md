Let's start with the big story here.
We got engaged!
And married!
(But that comes later.)

<span class="voice--tom">
Teresa asked me to marry her while we were celebrating nine months together.
</span>

<span class="voice--teresa">
All throughout our courtship we wrote letters to each other.
So I thought this was the perfect way of asking.
