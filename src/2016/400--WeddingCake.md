Now, where were we?
Oh right!
And in the middle of all of this,
</span>

## <span class="dark">We got married!</span>

<span class="dark">
Hitched.
Man and wife.
And we had an amazing wedding.
</span>

<span class="dark">
We rented a property north of Santa Fe for three nights
and hosted all of our immediate family.
It was relaxed.
In the days around the wedding people came and went as they pleased.
We explored Santa Fe.
We hiked.
We went to the [Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta][fiesta].
And we just generally had a good time together.
</span>

<span class="dark">
It was nice having our families together in one place,
the first time we were actually able to do that.
