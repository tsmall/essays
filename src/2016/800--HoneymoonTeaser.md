Right after Christmas we left for our honeymoon.
We wanted to include that here too,
but as you can see this was an exciting year for us,
and that's too much for one story.
But we'll be back soon with photos and tales from our trip through Scandinavia.
(Reindeer are involved!)

So check back soon.
We hope you had a wonderful year too.
Love and good wishes to you and yours.
Until next time...
