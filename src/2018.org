#+TITLE: 2018 Christmas Newsletter
#+AUTHOR: Tom Small III

* Introduction

The document you're reading now is the Smallgren newsletter for 2018.
We included a link to this site in the Christmas cards we sent in 2018.
You can see it running on [[http://www.smallgren.com/stories/2018][smallgren.com]].

This newsletter is written as a literate program.
It uses Emacs's Org Mode for formatting and tangling.

** A Quick Note On Styling

There's a new setting in the YAML top-matter this year: =extraclasses=.
This is a customization I made to Expose.
It lets me add custom CSS classes to the "post" divs.
So far I'm using it for only one reason:
to add the =boxed= class.

That is also a new class.
It adds a semi-transparent dark background
behind all of the text boxes.
It was very hard to read some of the text this year
no matter where I put the text.
This solves the problem.

** Title and Index

We start the newsletter with a title slide, as is tradition.

#+END_SRC

We're trying something new with this year's site: an index.
This includes a few paragraphs to introduce the site.
It also includes links to the main sections.
That way people can more easily jump right to the parts they care about.
Since there's a decent amount of content
we thought that might encourage people to actually read more of it.

  Dear family and friends, 

  It's been a busy two years since we last wrote; we have a lot to share with you! We've been on adventures together, saw old friends, made new friends, learned new things, and taken time to remember those we have lost. Although we're a little behind the holiday season, we hope you had a wonderful time surrounded by loved ones, and are having a wonderful start to the new year.

  Instead of just presenting photos of 2018 chronologically, you can use this index to jump to the stories you are interested in most. Click on one of the links below to be magically whisked right to that part of our story through the magic of the interwebs!

** Introductions

It has been a couple years since our last letter.
So we thought it would be a good idea to reintroduce ourselves.

  Hi, everyone! I haven't been on social media (other than Ruby's Instagram!) much in the last two years, so maybe I should catch you up on things. I've been teaching in the IB program at a charter school in Brooklyn since September of 2017. Originally hired to teach Theory of Knowledge and IB Psychology (not something I was ever trained for!), this year I am back to teaching Theory of Knowledge and  IB Art. I try to maintain a healthy work/life balance (although sometimes it feels like work is winning). Outside of work this year I took a couple trapeze lessons with a coworker, tried to teach myself banjo, (a nearly lifelong goal which I hope to move forward with), continue to play in the community orchestra, and still enjoy doing yoga and making art when I can.

  Hello! What have I been up to? I'm still an Engineering Manager at Schoology. I've had a chance to manage many people now and find seeing them succeed and grow and work well together very rewarding. I still make it a point to go to at least one Broadway show a month. And I still enjoy exploring NYC whenever I can. (This photo is at one of our favorite new restaurants in our neighborhood.)

  Our first trip this year was going up to Vermont in February. Our friends Micah and Geera invited us into their home for dinner with their family. They also showed us around Shelburne Museum, where we saw this wood carving of a sugar shack.

  We also spent time there relaxing, watching the Olympics, and spending an afternoon at the Von Trapp Brewery with Kayleigh and Alex.

  We went with our friend Molly Jane to the Dominican Republic in April for Spring Break. We visited Dave and Jen there, Teresa and Molly Jane's former coworkers from their time teaching in Dubai.

  It was a nice getaway, going from the cold and wet NYC weather to blue skies and clear turquoise water.

  Our first outing in the DR was going to Los Tres Ojos ("The Three Eyes") in Santo Domingo with Dave and Jen. It's a park right in the city where, a long time ago, they discovered three underground lakes and caves.

  More recently they found this, a fourth lake, the biggest and deepest. It's not considered one of the "eyes", though, because it has an opening to the surface.

  The most memorable part of exploring the caves for us was taking this raft across the second lake. This is the only way to get to the fourth lake. How they operate it is as unique as the experience of being on an underground lake: rather than use a motor or oars, the operator simply pulls the raft along a rope attached on both shores.

  We also went snorkeling in the ocean, a first for both of us. The tour took us to two different spots, one off the shore of a small island, and the other here, right above a shallow ship wreck. The schools of fish that made the sunken ship their home were mesmerizing.

  In the spring we spent most of our weekends going for hours-long walks. We both like exploring cities on foot. This photo is from one of our longest walks: the walk from our apartment in Fort Greene down to Coney Island about 10 miles.

  All that walking wasn't just for fun though; we were also preparing for The Great Saunter, a trek around the island of Manhattan done in a single day by about 1,500 people. It's organized by the Shore Walkers group as a fundraiser for preserving NYC's shores and walkways.

  The walk was 33 ½ miles, and we made it in about 11 ½ hours with a total of one hour of breaks. It was exhausting and exciting and long and beautiful. We saw parts of Manhattan we didn't even know existed, like a little red lighthouse under the George Washington Bridge, or the expansive forests of Inwood Hill Park.

  2018 would have been my mom's 50th high school reunion from Marymount in Quebec City. Since she could not be there, her high school classmates invited me and my sister, Carole, (and Tom and Tim) to attend the reunion in her place. It was such an honor to be included in the festivities, and such an emotional experience meeting so many people we'd hear stories of but had never met before. While they saw our mother in us, we saw parts of her in them, getting to know her in ways we hadn't been able to before.

  Since many classmates from Marymount no longer live in Quebec city, part of the reunion included a walking tour of the city, led by the older sister of one of mom/Lisa's classmates. It was enlightening to hear about not only the history of the city, but about all of the high school memories of the women as they walked around together.

  We hadn't been back to Iowa since our great wedding road trip, so for my birthday we stayed with my dad in Stanton for a week. We saw loads of family including aunts and uncles; first, second, third cousins, including once and twice removed; and all of their spouses. I also was able to spend some quality time with my Grandma Jean, talking about life, flipping through photo albums, and swinging on an assortment of porch swings.

  While in Iowa, I was able to do things that I wouldn't have the chance to do living in NYC. At my dad's he taught me some basic wood-turning on his lathe, I was able to pick some vegetables in his garden, and I rode in my Uncle Doug's Cessna Skyhawk, receiving an incredible tour of southwest Iowa as I'd never seen it before. The whole trip to Iowa was a reminder to slow down, to take time to work with my hands, and of the restorative possibilities of long conversations with people who've known you your whole life.

  We walked all around Lisbon, and on a whim decided to stop at the Castelo de São Jorge. We're so glad we did! It had an archaeological site showing buildings from three different centuries, starting with the Moors. And, as you can see here, an amazing view.

  I think the name of this wine stand chain in Lisbon sums up our trip well: "Wine With a View".

  Tasting the wines -- especially ports -- from the Douro Valley was one of the reasons we chose Portugal. So of course we needed to go to a port lodge. We chose Graham's. Their tour was interesting, and their port delicious.

We joined a tour, coincidentally ending up in a car with two other couples from New Jersey. Our tour guide Manuel took us all over the valley, including a boat ride on the Douro River itself. He also regaled us with stories, keeping us laughing the whole day.

  In September, Carole and Tim were passing through New York during their 3-month road trip through Canada and the US. I was insistent that they come to Lake Placid, a place that I have really come to love (not to mention the people who live there). While Carole and Tim were with us, we all went and did some Lake Placid things that I've never done before, like to go the Olympic ski jumps -- and see some teenagers do their summer training runs off of them!

  My Grandma Jean had a stroke in November, and died in early December. This photo was taken at my uncle's house in Iowa on the day of her funeral. I was so happy to have seen her this summer, and was able to return with Tom to celebrate her life. It was the first time all of her grandchildren were in the same place at the same time, we decided, in nearly 18 years. She would have been pleased to have us all in the same room, eating her Swedish rye bread and tea ring, spending time together.
  </span>

  <span class="voice--teresa voice--continued">
  Before she passed away, I asked my dad what her favorite Christmas carol was so I could play it at home, and he told me it was "Santa Lucia." The holiday of Santa Lucia is a Swedish tradition and is celebrated every year in the town in Iowa where Grandma lived her entire life. Perhaps fittingly, then, her funeral actually fell on the day of Stanton's annual Santa Lucia celebration, which we attended later that night with our cousins and their kids.

  <span class="voice--teresa voice--continued">
  It is also in memory of Grandma Jean that this year's card was designed, combining the "wildlife" of New York City where I live now with the Swedish symbols of Santa Lucia and the tomtar, or gnomes, who make appearances around Christmas. Swedish Christmas foods and traditions were always such a joy for me growing up, and there are many that I plan to learn and to keep in our household for years to come.
