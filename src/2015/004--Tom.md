## <span class="voice--tom">I'm Tom.</span>

<span class="voice--tom">
This is me, presenting at a local tech meet-up.
I'm originally from the site of the Miracle on Ice,
Lake Placid, NY.
I've lived in New York City for five years.
My interests are varied:
crafting software,
writing,
creating and listening to music,
and photography,
to list a few.
