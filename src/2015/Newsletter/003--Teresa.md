## <span class="voice--teresa">I'm Teresa.</span>

<span class="voice--teresa">
Originally from Colorado,
I'm now a graduate student at Pratt Institute
working on my MFA in Fine Art and MS in History of Art and Design.
This year I've taken up puppetry
and joined a community orchestra in Manhattan.
I used to teach art and philosophy at a high school in Dubai,
but am an eternal nerd an wanted to go back to school.
I love printmaking and Amy Poehler and Ruth Bader Ginsberg.
