We met on eHarmony,
and quickly found out we have a shocking number of things in common.
We both grew up in the mountains,
love good theater and bad puns,
love to travel near and far,
love the snow and winter sports,
and love being here in NYC.
Neither of us can leave a book store empty handed,
resist an enticing cocktail,
or avoid finding or making occasions to dress up.

And, as you can see, my sister has successfully converted us into Bills fans.
