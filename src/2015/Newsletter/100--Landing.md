## Our Trip to Colorado

<!-- Teresa Font -->
In July we traveled for a long weekend to Colorado,
for my dad's birthday
and my 10 year high school reunion.

<!-- Tom Font -->
This was my first time to Colorado and the Rocky Mountain region.
I was immediately drawn to its beauty as we came in for our landing.
