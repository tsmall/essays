## Our Trip to Colorado

<span class="voice--teresa">
In July we traveled for a long weekend to Colorado,
for my dad's birthday
and my 10 year high school reunion.

This was my first time to Colorado and the Rocky Mountain region.
I was immediately drawn to its beauty as we came in for our landing.
