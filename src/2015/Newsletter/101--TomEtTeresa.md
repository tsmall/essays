On our first day we drove up Trail Ridge Road,
into the Rocky Mountain National Park.

<!-- Tom Font -->
I got to experience my first high altitude experience.
I watched the altimeter on my phone climb and climb as we drove up the road,
reaching a height of 11,780 feet.

Actually, it was my first high altitude experience, too.
I guess living away from Colorado for four years
means you can get altitude sickness!
How unfortunate.
