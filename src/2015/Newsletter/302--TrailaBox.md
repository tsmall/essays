We also acquired a crazy cat
from my friend who unfortunately could no longer keep her.
(You may recognize her from our postcard.)
Her name is Traila,
but she also goes by Traila Rae Jepsen,
Traila Rae,
and Ms. Jepsen.
You can follow her on Instagram
at @traila_cat.
(We inherited this account also.)

As my sister said when I told her we got a cat,
"Nobody plans to get a cat. Cats just happen."
