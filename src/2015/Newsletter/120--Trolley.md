As part of the reunion in Fort Collins,
we took a ride on the historic downtown trolley.
The conductors
— volunteer trolley car enthusiasts —
talked about the history of trolleys in Fort Collins
and about the city itself.

This was nostalgic for a time before cars,
but also for our high school years when we would ride this during the summers.
