We've been busy this year,
mostly with work and school.
But even despite those obligations we've managed find time to enjoy much of what the city has to offer.

We've seen some incredible shows this year:
*Hamilton*,
*On The Town* (starring Teresa's cousin, Elizabeth Stanley),
*Les Miserables*,
*The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime*,
*A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder*,
*Hand to God*,
*Allegience*,
*Danny Elfman's Music from the Films of Tim Burton* and *Ramona* at Lincoln Center,
and lots of puppet shows in the Lower East Side
(some of which Teresa performed in).

We saw the New York Philharmonic play in Central Park,
featuring a solo by Joshua Bell.
We've eaten at more amazing restaurants than we can count.
We've seen many wonderful exhibits at the Whitney, MoMA PS1, and New Museum.
We've wandered all around the city.
We took a trip to the North Fork of Long Island together.

And we go to pub trivia (almost) every week,
with my friend Effie.
