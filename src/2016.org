#+TITLE: 2016 Valentine's Day Newsletter
#+AUTHOR: Tom Small III

* Introduction

The document you're reading now is the Smallgren newsletter for 2016. We
included a link to this site in the Valentine's Day cards we sent in 2017. You
can see it running on [[http://www.smallgren.com/stories/2016][Smallgren.com]].

This newsletter is written as a literate program. It uses Emacs's Org Mode for
formatting and tangling. See [[*Building]] below for the steps required to tangle
the source files.

* Building

Building the site from this source is a multi-step process. Right now you have
to perform many of the steps manually. Maybe some day I'll make it easier. But
for now, here's what you need to do.

1. Open this file in Emacs.
2. Tangle the source files by running ~org-babel-tangle~.
3. In a terminal, run the script =build.sh=.

When that finishes, the =src/_site= directory will contain the built website. You
can view it in your browser by running a local web server.

1. Navigate to =src/_site= in a terminal.
2. Run the command =python -m SimpleHTTPServer=.
3. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

** Introduction

Like we did for [[file:2015.org][last year's story]], we start with a title slide and a bit of
text to introduce the site. We aren't introducing ourselves again this year; we
did that last year, and it's still there for people to read.

  ## Happy Valentine's Day.

  Have we got a lot to share with you!
  2016 was an incredibly eventful year,
  personally,
  professionally,
  academically,
  pet-ly.
  Fami-ly?
  Traila has a new frenemy.
  We just got used to saying "fiancé(e)"
  before we needed to start saying "husband" and&nbsp;"wife."

  We're still happy here in New York City,
  seeing as much theater as we can
  and going to trivia nearly every week.
  (And we actually won!)

** The engagement

The first story this year is our engagement and marriage. We introduce both
here, though we will leave the wedding until later.

  Let's start with the big story here.
  We got engaged!
  And married!
  (But that comes later.)

  <span class="voice--tom">
  Teresa asked me to marry her while we were celebrating nine months together.
  </span>

  <span class="voice--teresa">
  All throughout our courtship we wrote letters to each other.
  So I thought this was the perfect way of asking.

  We got right to work planning our wedding.
  The first choice was where to host it.
  At the top of our list was Santa Fe, New Mexico.

  <span class="voice--teresa">
  I grew up going to Santa Fe every year for Spring Break.
  It has special importance for my family.
  But first I had to show it to Tom.
  </span>

  <span class="voice--tom">
  So we planned a trip out there to scout it out.
  And, as with Colorado, I loved it immediately.

** Meanwhile, back at the farm...

The wedding and road trip are the main attractions. But there is a lot of other
things to talk about too. Let's take a step back and talk about our new dog and
our achievements.

  ## We adopted a dog!

  Her name is Ruby.
  She's a [programmer's best friend][ruby].
  Here we are, taking her home from the adoption event.

  Although she is scared of *everything*,
  she took to us and her new home quickly.

  Ever since meeting her,
  Ruby has wanted nothing more than to become Traila's best friend.
  Traila, unfortunately, doesn't feel the same way.
  Quite the opposite in fact.

  <span class="voice--tom">
  But I'm still hopeful that, one day, they'll be buddies.
  Any day now.

  We also took quite a few weekend trips out of the city.
  We started by visiting Philadelphia.
  It was the first time either of us had been there.
  We didn't expect to nerd out on the history of the city as much as we did.
  But, still under the influence of *[Hamilton][]*,
  we couldn't resist seeing where it all happened.

  Now, where were we?
  Oh right!
  And in the middle of all of this,

  ## We got married!

  Hitched.
  Man and wife.
  And we had an amazing wedding.

  We rented a property north of Santa Fe for three nights
  and hosted all of our immediate family.
  It was relaxed.
  In the days around the wedding people came and went as they pleased.
  We explored Santa Fe.
  We hiked.
  We went to the [Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta][fiesta].
  And we just generally had a good time together.

  It was nice having our families together in one place,
  the first time we were actually able to do that.

  The food was delicious:
  New Mexican standards,
  enchiladas and chile rellenos.
  Everything felt perfect.

  Right after Christmas we left for our honeymoon.
  We wanted to include that here too,
  but, as you can see,that would be way too much for one story.
  But we'll be back soon with photos and tales from our trip through Scandinavia.
  (Reindeer are involved!)

  So check back soon.
  We hope you had a wonderful year too.
  Love and good wishes to you and yours.
  Until next time...
