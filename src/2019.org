  Happy (belated) holidays! It’s been a busy, exciting year, full of new travels and experiences and lots of time with family and friends. We hope you enjoy this glimpse into what our lives have been like since we last wrote.

  Not much new has happened this year compared to last. I continue to teach IB art and Theory of Knowledge at Brooklyn Prospect Charter School, which consumes most of my energy. I am working on finishing my official New York teaching certification, which is more work than it should be! I also keep playing my violin in the New York Session Symphony, a community orchestra in Manhattan, and played in the pit orchestra for a small production of Silent Spring. I’m so happy to travel around and out of the city when we can, and find the most joy in the time we spend exploring new places and experiences.

  Like Teresa, work has kept me pretty busy this year. It also gave me a surprise: in November the company I worked for, Schoology, was acquired by PowerSchool. Beyond work, it's been another wonderful year of travel and experiences together. I'm excited to share it with you. Read on!

  Our first major trip of the year was to Ireland (Northern and the Republic of). We traveled there with my sister, Carole, and her husband, Tim. The last time I was there was ten years ago with Carole, shortly after the death of our mom. We made this trip in her memory
  <br/><br/>
  It was also a time for us to share this place that is so meaningful to us with our husbands. Having traveled there twice with our mom when we were younger, we had many places to revisit, and some new places we wanted to explore together. (And roads to drive together on the left side!)

  Does this look familiar at all? We’ll give you a hint: Arya Stark walked this road when she fled Kings Landing.

  Turns out a lot of Game of Thrones was filmed in Northern Ireland. The Iron Islands are actually (a heavily CGI-modified version of) Dunluce Castle too.

  Summer also kicked off my participation in the MetPLC, a year-long program for NYC public school (and public charter school) teachers to learn how to develop and push their curriculum using works of art from The Met’s collection with a focus on equity and social justice. Between the guest speakers, access to art, field trips, and building community with this cohort of passionate, mission-driven teachers, this has been the most rewarding part of my year.

  They say time speeds up as you grow older. Nobody knows why, though there are a lot of theories. All we know is that the holidays came and went faster than ever before. It felt as though they had only just begun when they were over, and back to work we went. 2020 promises to be a year of challenges and changes, as all years are, but also of love and happiness, family and friends. We hope to see or hear from you all soon. May your year be filled with community, surrounded by those you love. 

  Peace and joy,

  Tom and Teresa
