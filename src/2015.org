#+TITLE: 2015 Christmas Newsletter
#+AUTHOR: Tom Small III

* Introduction

The document you're reading now is the Smallgren newsletter for 2015. We
included a link to this site in our Christmas cards that year. You can see it
running on [[http://www.smallgren.com/stories/2015][Smallgren.com]].

This newsletter is written as a literate program. It uses Emacs's Org Mode for
formatting and tangling. See [[*Building]] below for the steps required to tangle
the source files.

* Building

Building the site from this source is a multi-step process. Right now you have
to perform many of the steps manually. Maybe some day I'll make it easier. But
for now, here's what you need to do.

1. Open this file in Emacs.
2. Tangle the source files by running ~org-babel-tangle~.
3. In a terminal, run the script =build.sh=.

When that finishes, the =src/_site= directory will contain the built website. You
can view it in your browser by running a local web server.

1. Navigate to =src/_site= in a terminal.
2. Run the command =python -m SimpleHTTPServer=.
3. Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8000.

** Introduction

The first section of this newsletter is the introduction. Here, we provide a
title for the story, introduce the story as a whole, and introduce ourselves.

  ## It's been a wonderful year.

  So much has happened.
  We met early in the year and fell in love.
  We traveled north and west.
  We found a new apartment and moved in together.
  And, somehow, we ended up with a cat.

  Before we get into what we've done this year,
  we realize that not all of you may be familiar with us.
  So let us take a moment to introduce ourselves.

  Originally from Colorado,
  I'm now a graduate student at Pratt Institute
  working on my MFA in Fine Art and MS in History of Art and Design.
  This year I've taken up puppetry
  and joined a community orchestra in Manhattan.

  This is me, presenting at a local tech meet-up.
  I'm originally from the site of the Miracle on Ice,

  We met on eHarmony,
  and quickly found out we have a shocking number of things in common.
  We both grew up in the mountains,
  love good theater and bad puns,
  love to travel near and far,
  love the snow and winter sports,
  and love being here in NYC.
  Neither of us can leave a book store empty handed,
  resist an enticing cocktail,
  or avoid finding or making occasions to dress up.

  And, as you can see, my sister has successfully converted us into Bills fans.

  We've been busy this year,
  mostly with work and school.
  But even despite those obligations we've managed find time to enjoy much of what the city has to offer.

  We've seen some incredible shows this year:
  ,*Hamilton*,
  ,*On The Town* (starring Teresa's cousin, Elizabeth Stanley),
  ,*Les Miserables*,
  ,*The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime*,
  ,*A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder*,
  ,*Hand to God*,
  ,*Allegience*,
  ,*Danny Elfman's Music from the Films of Tim Burton* and *Ramona* at Lincoln Center,
  and lots of puppet shows in the Lower East Side
  (some of which Teresa performed in).

  We saw the New York Philharmonic play in Central Park,
  featuring a solo by Joshua Bell.
  We've eaten at more amazing restaurants than we can count.
  We've seen many wonderful exhibits at the Whitney, MoMA PS1, and New Museum.
  We've wandered all around the city.
  We took a trip to the North Fork of Long Island together.

  <span class="voice--teresa">
  And we go to pub trivia (almost) every week,
  with my friend Effie.

  We've had some adventures this year,

  ## Our Trip to Colorado

  <span class="voice--teresa">
  In July we traveled for a long weekend to Colorado,
  for my dad's birthday
  and my 10 year high school reunion.
  </span>

  <span class="voice--tom">
  This was my first time to Colorado and the Rocky Mountain region.
  I was immediately drawn to its beauty as we came in for our landing.

  On our first day we drove up Trail Ridge Road,
  into the Rocky Mountain National Park.

  <span class="voice--tom">
  This was my first high altitude experience.
  I watched the altimeter on my phone climb and climb as we drove up the road,
  reaching a height of 11,780 feet.
  </span>

  <span class="voice--teresa">
  Actually, it was my first high altitude experience, too.
  I guess living away from Colorado for four years
  means you can get altitude sickness!
  How unfortunate.

  I took Tom to one of my favorite places from my childhood, Swetsville Zoo.
  If you are ever in Northern Colorado,
  I recommend stopping off here to visit the dinosaurs and other creature creations
  made out of salvaged automobiles and farm equipment.

  As part of the reunion in Fort Collins,
  we took a ride on the historic downtown trolley.
  The conductors
  — volunteer trolley car enthusiasts —
  talked about the history of trolleys in Fort Collins
  and about the city itself.

  <span class="voice--teresa">
  This was nostalgic for a time before cars,
  but also for our high school years when we would ride this during the summers.

  We spent a day in Denver.
  While there, we visited former roommates from college days in Durango,
  Kelly and Erin;
  my best friend from elementary school, Tricia;
  and my Grandma and aunt and uncle.
  We also went to the Denver Botanic Gardens to see a Deborah Butterfield exhibit.

  ## Our (First) Trip to Lake Placid

  <span class="voice--tom">
  We went north to Lake Placid in early August,
  as soon as Teresa finished summer school.
  I was excited to bring Teresa to meet my family
  and to show her where I grew up.

  Next we drove up to the top of Whiteface Mountain
  to get a view of the Adirondack Park.
  </span>

  <span class="voice--teresa">
  I kept laughing at the altitude (their peaks are as high as our flatlands!),
  but I was impressed by the quality of the hiking.
  They're real mountains.

  After about a half hour drive and a 15 minute hike
  you get to the very top of Whiteface,
  where this observation tower sits.
  It's still actively used to study the weather,
  but it's also been converted into a tourist information center.

  I was really excited to have time away from the city and time on the lake.
  We went out with Tom's family on their electric boat
  for drinks and hors d'oeuvres and saw some loons,
  which I hadn't seen (or heard) in at least a decade.

  We found this great apartment in Fort Greene,
  in Brooklyn.
  We're now a couple blocks away from Fort Greene Park,
  right in the middle of a bunch of great restaurants,
  and only a 10 minute walk from Pratt.

  <span class="voice--tom">
  I moved down from Harlem, on the West side.

  <span class="voice--teresa">
  And I moved up from Flatbush.

  We also acquired a crazy cat
  from my friend who unfortunately could no longer keep her.
  (You may recognize her from our postcard.)
  Her name is Traila,
  but she also goes by Traila Rae Jepsen,
  Traila Rae,
  and Ms. Jepsen.
  You can follow her on Instagram
  at @traila_cat.
  (We inherited this account also.)

** Wrapping up

At the end, we wrap up by talking about all of the visitors we've had in the
last year and by wishing everyone a happy holidays.

  <span class="voice--tom">
  We've also had a lot of visitors this year.
  My sister and brother-in-law visited at the beginning of the year,
  and we had a great time brunching in Brooklyn together.
  I saw the opening of *Mad Max: Fury Road* the only right way,
  with Liam,
  joining him for his third showing on opening day.
  I had a great time exploring the upper west side of Manhattan with my mom.
  And I got to be the tour guide on my dad and step-mom's first visit to Brooklyn.
  Here's to even more visits and adventures in 2016.
  </span>

  <span class="voice--teresa">
  This winter, my dad came to visit NYC for his first time since before I was born,
  and my friend Kathryn came to visit from Istanbul.
  This summer, my childhood friend Cindy,
  came and we hit up museums together and saw the mermaid parade at Coney Island.
  Over the Fourth of July weekend my aunt Julie and cousin Breanna came for their first time to The City to see all there is to see.
  I had many former coworkers come from Dubai, including Holly, Genna, Lisa, and Emma,
  all for various reasons and at different times.
  (I need to mention my coworkers from Dubai
  — Molly, Haley, and Kim —
  whom I see on a regular basis, because it's so wonderful to see them as often as I do.
  But they actually live here in Brooklyn now, too, so aren't visitors.)
  </span>

  <span class="voice--teresa voice--continued">
  I'm also so lucky to have relatives who repeatedly come to New York,
  my mom's cousin Sarah and her husband David,
  and her son Adam and his wife Liz.
  It helps that they used to live here and always have so many reasons to come back.
  </span>

  <span class="voice--teresa voice--continued">
  Last, but certainly not least, my sister Carole and her husband Tim are coming to Brooklyn for Christmas.
  It will be their first time visiting since I've moved here, and I couldn't be more excited.
